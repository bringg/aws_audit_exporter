# Prometheus AWS audit exporter

This program is primarily intended to assist with billing.
Collects various AWS statistics, exports them as prometheus metrics, and saves them in RDBMS.

Run help or check main.go for program parameters
Debug messages are disabled by default

Currently the following metrics are exported:

## EC2 Spot Instance Pricing

Only prices for products that have been seen in spot instance requests are tracked.

- *aws_ec2_spot_price_per_hour_dollars*: The current market price for a spot instance

The following labels are exposed:

- *az*: availability zone
- *family*: Instance family
- *instance_type*: Type of instance

## Usage

  Your aws credentials should either be in $HOME/.aws/credentials , or set via AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY and AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY

  Usage of /go/bin/aws_audit_exporter:
  -addr string
        port to listen on (default ":9190")
  -duration duration
        How often to query the API (default 4m0s)
  -instance-tags string
        comma seperated list of tag keys to use as metric labels
  -region string
        the region to query (default "us-east-1")

## IAM Role

Below is an IAM role with the required permissions

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeReservedInstances*",
        "ec2:DescribeSpot*",
        "ec2:DescribeVpcClassicLink"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Write data to Postgres

Writes data to postgres to allow longer retention, and data aggregations
Was tested on postgresql 9.6 in RDS

Some information in the DB is eventual consistent, i.e. it will take a full iteration for data to be updated.

hstore extention needs to enable on the database in use
Run with a privelleged user:

```shell
aws_audit=> CREATE EXTENSION hstore;
```
